## <a href="https://adityamamta.github.io/toggle-switch/"><img src="img/readme-btn.png" alt="Click to view live website" height="120"></a>

A stylish toggle switch button that alternates between "Locked" and "Unlocked" states, complete with smooth transitions and dynamic text/icon changes. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the toggle switch responds to click and Enter key events. The Material Icons font is used for the lock and unlock icons, which animate with a sliding effect and color change. The project offers a clean UI suitable for interactive and visually appealing applications.
